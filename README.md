## üó£Ô∏è About this project

Project for the Deep Learning Course @ Instituto Superior T√©cnico.<br/>

In this project several Deep Learning algorithms where implemented, ranging from a simple Perceptron to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's), Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM's), Attention mechanisms and more.

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of project1**](https://github.com/vascopearson/Deep_Learning_course/blob/master/Project1/homework1.pdf)
and the [**subject of project2**](https://github.com/vascopearson/Deep_Learning_course/blob/master/Project2/homework2.pdf).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The project is written in **Python** and thus requires Python and some Python libraries to run.<br/>
The pdfs with the answers for project1 and project2 are available [**here**](https://github.com/vascopearson/Deep_Learning_course/blob/master/Project1/AP_homework1_group41.pdf)
